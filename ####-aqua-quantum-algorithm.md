## Summary

Aqua's quantum algorithms are of type `QuantumAlgorithm`, which dictates that all algorithms must be executed via a  `run` method whose arguments specify the backend used for circuit execution. This structure makes passing algorithm instances to meta algorithms difficult and hacky as once instantiated the problem the algorithm solves is essentially fixed.

This RFC discusses the issues of the current `QuantumAlgorithm` and tries to assess, whether
this base type is still useful or if it might complicate the development of quantum algorithms.

The below proposal introduces the following:
1. **Interface Classes** - Non-mutually-exclusive base classes for various types of algorithms, such as MinEigenSolver, ClassicalAlgorithm, Classifier, or AmplitudeEstimator, enforcing a consistent execution signature (`get_min_eigenvalue()`) which is still flexible enough to support diverse execution flows for different algorithm _types._
1. **Remove `.run` Requirement** - For algorithms where a `.run(backend)` execution interface is not natural, such as Classifiers (init, train, test, predict), remove the requirement that QuantumAlgorithms include a `run(backend)` method as it is no longer required for dictionary-based execution.
1. **Incomplete Construction and Reuse** - Give algorithms the discretion for some constructor parameters to be left empty for population later, allowing sub-algorithms to be passed around without having to be fixed to a specific problem, and for some execution methods to be reusable with components passed in (e.g. `my_expectation.get_expectation(my_circ)`).
1. **Directory Simplification** - Remove the non-standard `single-sample`, `many-sample`, and `adaptive` nomenclature from the algorithms directory in favor of a flatter, simpler structure (TODO link below), and promote the Optimizers into the algorithms directory, as they are algorithms.

## Motivation
- Why are we doing this?
    - Current structure:
        - TODO: background about pluggables and the necessity of the current structure for the JSON interface. Algorithms used to need to be specified in a backend-agnostic way.
        - To run a quantum algorithm, one initializes the algorithm with all necessary properties
        and then calls `run(backend)`, specifying a backend (or quantum instance) for the
        circuit execution. This method returns the algorithm result.
        - All quantum algorithms inherit from the abstract `QuantumAlgorithm` type, which requires
        an implementation of the actual algorithm execution via the `_run()` method.
        This method is called, when the user calls `run(backend)`.
        - Noteable facts:
          - Not all algorithms construct circuits or require a quantum backend
          - The problem the algorithm solves is defined in the initializer

        The execution is only allowed to take a `QuantumInstance` plus configuration. Thus, all configuration must take place before the execution, mostly in the initializer. In this execution, most (all?) algorithms construct circuits using the information provided in the initializer, execute all iterations, process the outcome and return the result.
    - Problems introduced by the legacy structure:
        1. Algorithms are fixed, the problems they solve are not. Why do we have to specify
        a new algorithm instance for each problem when we could just input the information when
        we actually run it?
        1. Missing flexibility: configuring the algorithm in the initializer makes the algorithm instance problem-specific. We are therefore unable to pass an algorithm instance that can solve different problems to meta algorithms. Examples: ADMM, any optimization, etc.
        1. The term "algorithm" is extremely broad. Classical algorithms don't share a common base
        class (compare Qiskit, scikit, etc.), why should quantum algorithms share one?
        1. Naming: every single quantum algorithm has is executed using `run`, though other names
        can be much more expressive. Optimizers `optimize` or `minimize` a quantity, neural networks `learn`, HHL `solve`s, etc. Classical algorithms do not have this naming restriction,
        why should quantum algorithms have them?
        1. If an algorithm runs and compares multiple backends or settings, this is not supported in
        a convenient manner.
        1. Algorithms can be hardware specific, the backend must be known beforehand and it doesn't
        make sense to provide the backend in `run`.
        1. Information about the algorithm information (target precision, iterations, number of
        ancillas, ...) and problem information (Hamiltonian, cost function, ...) are not distinguished.
    - These problems are summarized in the following concerns:
        1. The `run` method is restrictive for the huge variety of quantum algorithms.
        2. An algorithm instance should solve different problems.
        3. The backend should not be required in `run`.

        As all the `QuantumAlgorithm` does is requiring a `run(backend)` and providing the same base type for all algorithms -- which might not be necessary -- this raises the question: Do we really need it?

- What will this (= lifting the restrictions of `QuantumAlgorithm`) enable?
  - Use the same algorithm instance to solve multiple problems.
  - The main method of an algorithm can be named after its actual action.
  - Multiple backends may be used within an algorithm. TODO: Motivate this.

- What will be the outcome?
  - Generally more flexibility in developing and using quantum algorithms.
  - Less re-defining of the same algorithm just for different problems.

- Who will benefit?
  - Any user of algorithms by having more precise names for the algorithm executions.
  - Quantum algorithm & application (QA&A) programmers, implementing more rigorous algorithms
    by having being more flexible in the development of quantum algorithms.
  - Newcomers: since quantum algorithms don't have this inherent difference to classical ones.
  - Code-checkers, since we don't need to re-define almost the same instance over and over again (and thus have fewer of code!)

## User Benefit
- Who are the target users of this work?
    - QA&A programmers
    - Aqua users in general

- How will users or contributors benefit from the work proposed?
  - Users
    -  more expressive and domain-friendly executation interfaces
        -  `solve(problem)` is a well-known and more natural execution structure in optimization
        - Train/Test/Predict or Fit/Test/Predict is a well-known and more natural execution structure in machine learning, and is used across Scikit-learn
    -  no need to re-define the same algorithm for different problems
    -  one less class to learn about, less wondering about where `run` actually comes from
    -  easier to pass algorithm instances around
  - Contributors:
    -  no need to re-define the same algorithm for different problems
    -  one less class to learn about, less wondering about where `run` actually comes from
    -  easier to pass algorithm instances around
    -  more flexibility in the definition of the algorithm

## Design Proposal

### One-instance-many-problems-design

We would ideally like to achieve the following:
```
algorithm = Algorithm(**settings)
for problem in problems:
    algorithm.run(problem)
```
This means moving the information about the backend into the initializer,
and information about the problem from the initializer to `run`.
Can this be done? See open questions.

### Component Reuse

A consistent behavior should be enforced for component reuse within an algorithm. Specifically, we should enforce the following:
* Any component instance passed into the constructor or setter will be the default instance for that component. If an execution function is called, that instance will be used.
* For component instances passed to execution methods, e.g. `my_vpe.run(ansatz=my_ansatz)`, *where the execution function has been built to accept that component,* there are two options:
    * Option A: Any component instance passed into an execution function will override the default instance only for that execution. This allows alternate components to be tested during notebook or Python shell prototyping.
    * Option B: If an instance of a component is set in the constructor and another is passed into the execution function, and error will be thrown.

**Suggestion:** We prefer option A, as 1) users calling execution functions with component instances generally understand that they are specifying that function to be run with that instance, so there is little ambiguity (how often will a user call `my_vpe.run(ansatz=my_ansatz)` and wonder why the ansatz passed in the constructor wasn't used?), and 2) option B will force more needless and error-prone calls like:
```
temp = my_vqe.ansatz
my_vqe.ansatz = new_ansat
my_vqe.get_min_eig()
my_vqe.ansatz = temp
```

### Naming of `run`

Option A: Remove the abstract `run` method from `QuantumAlgorithm`, let every algorithm decide how the main execution should be called.

Option B: Keep `run` but let every algorithm define a more specific alias.

Option C: Keep `run` for some algorithms, but let other classes of algorithms define a more specific interface without a `.run`.

**Suggestion** We prefer option A.
The added confusion by adding an alias seems not worth keeping `run`.
Option C can still be realized within Option A.

In any case: Keep a deprecated `run` and tell the user what the new, changed behaviour is.

### Do we need the `QuantumAlgorithm`?

|                                      | algorithms might have different requirements than `run(backend)` |

**Suggestion** Remove the base type `QuantumAlgorithm`. If several algorithms share the same base,
create a base type for this, such as already existing for `VQAlgorithm` or `AmplitudeEstimationAlgorithm`.
This is not a change users note.
To maintain backward compatibility and to warn the users, keep `run` in the algorithms but deprecate it.

### Algorithm Base Classes and Alternate Execution Methods

The following base classes could replace QuantumAlgorithm for some algorithms to provide more clarity and structure to the algorithm interfaces. Note that many algorithm will inherit from multiple base classes.
1. `VQAlgorithm` (already exists) - provides core structure and utilities for running variational optimization, so inheritors need only specify a cost function. Also supply valuable getters and setters, such as `.optimal_params`, `get_optimal_circuit`, `get_optimal_cost`, `.ansatz`, `.initial_point`, etc.
    1. Examples: VQE, VQC, QGAN, QAOA (via VQE)
1. `AmplitudeEstimationAlgorithm` (already exists) - provides functionalities to set and get the problem definition via the $A$, $Q$ and $S$ operators and ensure that all amplitude estimators have the same execution function, so they can easily be swapped for one another.
2. `MinEigenSolver` - Many algorithms require a MinEigenSolver as a subroutine, and an enforced interface would allow users to pass their eigensolver of choice into an application or meta-algorithm.
    1. Instance methods may include:
        1. `get_min_eigenvalue` - As described above, should return the result if the result has already
    2. Examples: VQE, QAOA, QPE, ExactEigensolver
3. `Classifier` - TODO
    1. Examples: VQC, QSVM, Classical SVM
4. `LinearSolver`- TODO
    1. Examples: HHL, ExactLSsolver
5. `ExpectationAlgorithm` - TODO
6. `EvolutionAlgorithm` - TODO
7. `VariationalOptimizer` - TODO
8. `GradientAlgorithm` - TODO
    1. Examples: ParameterShiftGradient, NumericalGradient

**Decision** We should consider naming these to consistently end with "Algorithm" or an adjective, such as "Estimator" or "Solver."

### Algorithm Directory Hierarchy

 The present organization of the algorithm directory is unintuitive, and relies on naming conventions which are not industry standard in Quantum algorithms. We should update this to reflect a more intuitive structure. Some options:
1. Fully flat - all algorithms in one directory
1. Group by algorithm behavior - Variational, Classical, Oracular - and flat otherwise
1. Group by algorithm purpose - MinEigenSolver, LinearSolver, AmplitudeEstimation - and flat otherwise
1. Flat, except a few obvious exceptions - Classical, Oracular, AmplitudeEstimation - to keep things tidy

**Decision** We suggest to group algorithms by their purpose, plus an optional division into
classical and quantum algorithms before that. All algorithms that share the same base class
are maintained within the same directory.

This could for instance look like
```
qiskit/aqua/algorithms
            âââ classical
            â   âââ optimizer
            âââ quantum
                âââ amplitude_estimation
                âââ classifier
                âââ min_eigen_solver
```

### Storing Results

It is often desirable for an algorithm to store additional result information after executing. For example, when running VQE, often the optimal parameters are also needed. In addition, often information about the computation itself is desirable, such as the number of iterations. In Python, generally results are not cached inside the execution object, but rather returned from execution functions as multiply-returned tuples and never stored. However, this structure would break the interchangeability of various algorithms in Aqua, as if VQE returned `(min_eigval, optimal_parameters)`, QPE or ExactEigensolver obviously would not do the same. This problem is solved in Aqua today by storing these values in a dictionary in a `.ret` instance variable, but does not enforce consistency between the algorithms and forces the user to inspect source code to understand how to access these values. So there are three core user journeys which must be met:
1. I am running VQE to study its behavior, and therefore want access to many other aspects of execution. I do not want to rerun the algorithm to access different computed properties. Sometimes I am forgetful while prototyping and realize that after I called `get_min_eigenvalue` that I also wanted the `optimal_params`.
1. I am an algorithm which requires an eigensolver as a subroutine (e.g. ADMM), and I want to simply call `get_min_eigenvalue`, without needing to branch for different multiply returned tuples or "return" objects from different algorithms. Sometimes I need to access different properties one after another, e.g. calling `get_eigen_circuit` after `get_minimum_eigenvalue`, and I don't want to have to rerun to do so.
1. I am an algorithm which requires a variational algorithm as a subroutine. I want to call `get_minimum_parameters` without needing to understand some `EigenSolverResults` object vs. a `VQCResult` object. Sometimes I need to access multiple properties, e.g. call `get_minimum_cost` and then `get_optimal_circuit`, and I don't want to have to rerun to do so.

We propose the following structure across Aqua and the App stacks:

* Heavy execution functions, such as `.solve` for the Optimization algorithms or `.find_minimum` for VQAlgorithms should return a result object, and store it in a `.result` instance variable.
* Getters for computed properties (e.g. `get_min_eigenvalue` or `.optimal_params`) should check whether `.result` contains the required property, and if not, execute. This is the structure already used by the `VQAlgorithm` base class. This way, the logic for how the data in the `.result` object are accessed can be contained in the algorithm.
    * This introduces a possible ambiguity where a user may change components of the algorithm and then call a getter for a computed property. Therefore, we should wipe the results object in the component setters so the computed property must be recomputed the next time it is requested. If the user wants to modify the components and then re-access a previously computed property for a set of component instances, this constitutes hacking and the user can access the private (underscore) component variables.

## Detailed Design

Implementation procedure:
1. deprecate the class initializer of `QuantumAlgorithm`
2. extend `_run` to `run` in all algorithms, if a better name exists, rename `run` and deprecate it
3. move the backend information into the initializer, and the problem information to the execution function

Note, that these changes are possibly without breaking backward compatibility.
For example:
```
class MyAlgorithm:
    def __init__(self, settings,
                 problem=None,  # changed: problem specification is optional
                 backend=None, **backend_kwargs):  # added: backend info
        self._quantum_instance = ...
        self._algorithm_settings = ...
        self._problem_specifications = ...  # warning: set the problem using `solve`

    def solve(self, problem):
        return ...

    def run(self, backend, **kwargs):  # warning: use `solve` instead of run
        self._quantum_instance = ...
        return self.solve(self._problem_specifications)
```


## Questions
- Why was the information about the backend in `run`? GUI? Can it be moved to the initializer?
